----------------

1). Single flow of control

Let see how flow of control goes | run while program is single threaded.

Let examine for the given example,
.....................................
Control flow (1).  first control enters into the main().
Control flow (2). now it call the display(), and control goes transfer to calling method i.e. display().
Control flow (3). Control comes to called method that is display() here.
Control flow (4). Control goes not next item that I have to print inside the display() method.
Control flow (5). After running the called method it would comes out from the method that is called from the main() and runs the next item that is inside the main(). here it is a printing statement.
 

Conclusion: so that here given program is single threaded.
